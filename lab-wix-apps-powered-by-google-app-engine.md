Lab: Wix Apps powered by Google App Engine
==================================
Since 2008 more than 29 million websites have been built using Wix' industry leading, drag-and-drop web publishing platform. 
Renowned for its creative, no-coding-needed flexibility, small businesses and individuals have flocked to Wix to build their websites. 
Each month more than 4 million people engage with the Wix editor and publish over 1 million new websites.

In October 2012 Wix created a massive new web developer opportunity with the launch of the Wix App Market, enabling a seamless integration 
of third party apps into the Wix platform. How big an opportunity? With Wix' massive user-base, 2 months from launch, the App Market is 
already generating more than 300,000 app installations every month. Currently, with less than 70 apps in the Wix App Market, the average 
app is getting more than 3,000 installations per month.

In this lab, we will explore building a Wix App using Google App Engine (GAE) and demonstrate how to deploy and publish the apps into Wix.com. 
We will review all the major components of building a Wix app, including back-end, front-end, App Market integration and billing solutions.

The Lab will be based on the GAE Java APIs. Prior experience with Java is required, but no prior knowhow with GAE is needed.
