Lab: Wix Apps powered by Google App Engine
==================================
Since 2008 more than 28 million websites have been built using Wix' state-of-industry, drag-and-drop web building editor. Renowned for its creative, no-coding-needed flexibility, small businesses and individuals have flocked to the Wix platform. More than 4 million people engage with the editor each month, publishing more than 1 million new websites during that same timeframe.

With this as a foundation, a massive new web developer opportunity presented itself in October of 2012 as the the Wix App Market launched and was integrated within the Wix editor. How big an opportunity? At present there are more than 300,000 app installations through the Wix App Market every month. Currently, with less than 70 apps in the App Market, the the average app is getting more than 3,000 installations per month.

In this lab, we will explore building a Wix App using Google App Engine (GAE) as a foundation. We will explore building and deploying web applications with GAE, building and deploying Wix Apps based on GAE and publishing apps into Wix.com. 
We will go over all the major components of building Wix Apps, including backend, frontend and App Market integrations as well as billing solutions.

The Lab will be based on the GAE Java APIs. Prior experience with Java is required, but no prior knowhow with GAE is needed.
